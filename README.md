Hello everyone! We are the team from Carleton University, and we’re excited to introduce our project: IELTS Speaking Simulator
We arrived in Canada just one month ago and are thrilled to participate in Hack the Hill.

As international students whose native language isn’t English, we’ve dedicated significant time and resources to improve our English proficiency, particularly in speaking, to prepare for our academic journey. Specifically, we’ve focused on the IELTS Speaking test.

According to the latest official IELTS data, the speaking section has the lowest average score among the four tests, with an average of 5.5 in China, compared to the highest average score of 6.3 in reading. It’s also the lowest speaking band score among all countries.

In China alone, nearly 1 million people prepare for the IELTS exam each year.  “Many students resort to memorizing answers or using ineffective apps. Personal IELTS tutors can cost around $50 per hour, which isn’t affordable for most.

To address this, we’ve developed IELTS Speaking Simulator, a GPT-powered tool that offers authentic IELTS speaking practice.

Our simulator provides realistic test simulations by leveraging ChatGPT’s advanced capabilities. It randomly selects up-to-date topics from the latest IELTS question bank and offers personalized feedback with score estimations.

Without a deep technical background, we faced challenges like enabling random topic selection. Initially, uploading the question bank into ChatGPT didn’t work. We then wrote Python code using the Code Interpreter, but it was unstable. Finally, we combined ChatGPT with a Cloudflare Worker to select topics based on user input. 

Crafting effective prompts to control ChatGPT’s output was challenging. Unlike traditional coding, prompt engineering requires precise language. We also iterated over 50 times, refining our prompts to ensure ChatGPT followed our set rules and provided consistent outputs.

Using our tool is simple: select the part of the test you want to simulate and start the conversation.

Afterward, you’ll receive an estimated band score.

 We provide instruction to improved answers, key point summaries, and personalized feedback.

Our solution makes quality speaking practice accessible and affordable, helping international students build confidence. It bridges language gaps and has the potential to scale to other languages and standardized tests.

Through this project, we learned new technologies like ChatGPT’s advanced features, Cloudflare Workers, and prompt engineering. We overcame significant roadblocks despite our limited technical background.

Looking ahead, we plan to incorporate real-time voice conversations using ChatGPT’s advanced voice mode, provide voice feedback on pronunciation and fluency, and expand our tool to other standardized speaking tests and languages.
